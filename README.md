# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

# Description
This web-based Tic Tac Toe game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid to achieve three marks in a row, column, or diagonal to win the game. The game also detects a draw when all spaces are filled without a win.
The game features a clean and user-friendly interface, providing visual feedback on the current player's turn and announcing the winner or a draw at the end of the game.

# Features
* Players take turns to place their marks (X or O) in the grid by clicking on the boxes.
* The game announces the winner when a player forms a line of three of their marks.
* In case of a draw (when all boxes are filled and no winner), the game declares a draw.
* Reset functionality to start a new game at any time.
* The game utilizes basic CSS styling for a simple and responsive design.
